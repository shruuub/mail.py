# mail.py
A simple Mail send client written in python. Technically working, "config" changes needed - not maintained. 
- You need to have less secure apps enabeled (for gmail, thats https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps )
- and yeah, thats it, have fun
- you can modify the code however you want, but i won't be responsible for anything.
